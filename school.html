        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>The School began on April 16, 2003 as Bharatiya Vidya Bhavanâ€™s Public School in association with Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai.

The School focuses on inculcating the best in its students by providing an environment in which the students discover and realize their potential with a view to empowering them to be responsible citizens and leaders of the nation and the global society of tomorrow. We encourage a value system that is essentially Indian yet catering to the global perspective, being a CBSE school, sharing online facilities that enable us to be a pool school, where ideas are shared and welcomed.

The school has carved a niche for itself as One of the most reputed schools in Indirapuram and the National Capital Region. The school has evolved and established excellent systems, which facilitate the children to receive the best education and be groomed to meet all the challenges of life. The school under the CBSE affiliation, follows all guidelines as specified by www.cbse.nic.in during class 10 and class 12 examinations. Indirapuram Public School is a leading school that finds recognition among the top ten schools in the NCR region and has appeared in the Top Ten Schools list of Times of India school survey for consecutive years.

We are proud to have on our faculty a team of capable and experienced teachers. An extremely competent Principal having experience of working in the top schools in India and beyond who provides innovating ideas to the education group. A capable and supportive managing body has provided all essential support to ensure that the school functions as an example of excellence among top schools in Ghaziabad, Noida and Delhi. Coupled with the excellent infrastructure available, Indirapuram Public School can rightly boast of an optimal mix of excellent teachers, competent guidance, visionary management and world-class infrastructure. Putting all this together, Indirapuram Public School aims to provide the very best of education to students, taking them from pre-primary level into suggesting approaches and guidance on what to do after class 12.

We look forward to an intense and collective synergy with our students and their parents with a view to take our vision of providing quality education forward. Online admission facilities at all levels, especially providing, online admission to 11th grade students from neighboring areas is our priority. The availability of multiple choices of subjects to select at the time of 11th standard provides the students an option to choose a subject of their interest and aptitude even through online admission procedures.</p>

      Parents are requested to see that their child adheres to the School norms strictly.
        </p>
        
        <p>1.Punctuality and regularity in attendance is essential. Students who have been absent the previous day must bring a note of explanation through 'Record of Non-attendance' pages of the almanac without fail. In case of illness a Medical Certificate should be submitted. Students who reach home late after the school due to personal reasons must inform their parents/ guardians in advance. Irregular attendance, unjustified or unexplained absence from school, habitual late coming, leaving the school premises without permission, disobedience and any type of unruly and objectionable behaviour are considered to be grave acts of indiscipline on the part of a student which can lead to his/her rustication from the school.</p>
        
        <p>2.For the student whose reporting time is say 7.50 a.m., he or she should not enter school premises before 7.30 am. 7.50 am to 8.00 am would be considered as late arrival but child can enter the school and past 8.00 am no student would be allowed to enter the school.</p>
        
        <p>3.Students must come to school in neatly laundered uniform and polished shoes. The hair should be trimmed and the nails must be cut regularly. Trinket, jewellery, henna or tattoos should not be worn to school. Girls with long hair should make plaits. Skirts should be worn knee-length.
